                        <p>The man who built and designed the CruisAire was Ray Frank. He designed the Dodge motorhome in the early 1960s and shortly thereafter sold the company. The company was renamed "Travco." Ray Frank started working on a "garageable" motorhome. His first design was the 1966 Chevrolet CruisAire (the van we restored). He only built seven of these. In 1968, he developed the Dodge Xplorer, and production started with the 1969 model on the Dodge "A" van chassis. In 1971, Dodge went to the "B" van chassis. After a run of 274 "A's," he reworked the interior so it went into the "B's." These were so successful that Xplorer was building the "B" campers up until 2003. The company, Frank Industries, was sold, but Xplorer continued to produce.</p>
                        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Calvin Hunter</h3>
                        <p>Calvin John Hunter was born on February 23, 1932, in Diamondville, Wyoming. He was the youngest of four children and grew up in the nearby town of Kemmerer. As a child, Calvin spent much of his time hunting, fishing, and exploring Wyoming with his family. Throughout his middle and high school years, he worked various jobs, including as a gas station attendant, bellhop at a local hotel, and trumpet player in a band. He was good friends with Jerry Buss, the future owner of the Los Angeles Lakers, who also grew up in Kemmerer.</p>
                        <p>Calvin taught himself to play golf by reading a book by golfing legend Ben Hogan and practiced at the local course. He became a two-time Wyoming state champion and played in the Junior National Championships with Bobby Casper. He later played golf at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. After completing two condensed years of college, he was accepted to dental school at Northwestern University in Chicago.</p>
                        <p>While in dental school, Calvin met Marilyn McCaffery at a sorority party in Evanston. Marilyn, who was also attending Northwestern, hailed from Lovell, a small town in Wyoming. After graduating, they were married in Marilyn's hometown of Lovell and soon moved to Fairbanks, Alaska, where Calvin was stationed as a Captain in the Air Force. Their first child, Calvin John Hunter Jr., was born in Alaska. After fulfilling his two-year service commitment, the family moved to Casper, Wyoming, where Calvin practiced dentistry for three years. They then returned to Northwestern, where Calvin completed a specialty residency in orthodontics.</p>
                        <p>Upon completing his residency, Calvin, Marilyn, and their four children moved to Pueblo, Colorado, where he took over an orthodontic practice. The family grew with the addition of three more children, though they tragically lost one in an auto accident.</p>
                        <p>The family later relocated to Rye, Colorado, a small town 30 miles west of Pueblo. There, they began purchasing land for a cattle ranch they named Rock Meadow Ranch. During this period, Calvin's father passed away from a stroke. Shortly after, Calvin acquired his parents' cherished camper, a 1966 Chevrolet CruisAire, which they had taken on several trips, including a memorable journey to the World's Fair in Spokane, Washington, in 1974.</p>
                        <p>Calvin and Marilyn spent their lives on Rock Meadow Ranch in Rye, Colorado, raising their children and traveling the world. Marilyn passed away in 2013. Today, at age 92, Calvin still resides on the ranch, actively involved in raising cattle and restoring the family camper, the 1966 Chevy CruisAire.</p>
